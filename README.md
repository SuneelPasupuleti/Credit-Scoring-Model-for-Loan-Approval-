# Credit-Scoring-Model-for-Loan-Approval-

🔍 Overview
This project builds a credit scoring model to predict loan approval using machine learning techniques. It analyzes key financial indicators such as annual income, loan amount, loan term, CIBIL score, and education level to assess loan eligibility.

📌 Features
✅ Machine Learning-based Loan Approval Prediction
✅ Model Comparison: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost
✅ Advanced Techniques: SMOTE for class balancing, LSTM + Random Forest ensemble
✅ Gradio-powered interactive UI for real-time predictions
✅ Deployed on Hugging Face for easy access
